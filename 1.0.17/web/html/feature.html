      <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Kameti? <span class="text-muted">Save money without bank</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Kametie's are very popular in India and Pakistan. The Kameti System involves a group of people (can range from 10-20) coming together to form a "Kameti" where each person contributes certain
amount of money towards a corpus of funds.


Typically the person initiating the Kameti is the administrator/cashier of the Kameti and is responsible for each transaction and servicing of everything that goes for that particular kameti.

All kameti member mutually decide the kameti rule. Like kameti start date , auction time, interest rate, plenty amount, lucky draw amount, minimum bid amount, runner up percentage etc.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">How does it works? <span class="text-muted">Let us try to understand</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Lets assume that Mr. X is the administrator/cashier of a kameti floated by him having 10 members and each member contributes Rs. 5,000 towards the corpus which amounts to Rs. 50,000 (Total Kameti Amount).
Now the kameti holds an auction on a given date and time (10th of every month at 6:30PM) among the 10 members for granting this corpus as a debt.
The auction amount is basically the interest (say 1%) portion on the corpus.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Auction for the corpus <span class="text-muted">is started.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">So in this kameti of Mr. X with a corpus of Rs. 50,000 the first auction starts at lets say Rs. 4500 which is equal to 1% for 9 months. What is means is that the person will start bidding
(Boli start) Rs. 4500 for first kameti, if another member want to bid he/she need to add Rs 100 (minimum incremental bid amount) on Rs 4500. So now kameti bid amount is Rs 4600. If he/she wins the auction at that bid, will take the Rs. 50,000 corpus for a cost of Rs. 4600 so effectively he will get Rs. 44,000.

So now there is benefit of Rs 5200 is this amount which will be divided in between all the 10 members. In this way every member got the benefit of Rs 520/- for that month of the kameti.</p>
